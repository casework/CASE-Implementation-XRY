# CASE Implementation XRY - Examples

### Overview

This directory serves as the output location for example CASE graphs that have been produced after converting outputs from MSAB's XRY or XAMN.

### Usage

All files in this directory with the extension `.jsonld` will automatically be validated using a GitHub Action that confirms their conformance to CASE v0.6.0. 

All artifacts and sources must be publicly releasable. One option is to use images from the Digital Corpora such as the [Android 10](https://digitalcorpora.org/corpora/cell-phones/android-10).
